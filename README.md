# NoSketch Engine Docker

This is a dockerised version of [NoSketch Engine](https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske), the open source version of [Sketch Engine](https://www.sketchengine.eu/) corpus manager and text analysis software developed by [Lexical Computing Limited](https://www.lexicalcomputing.com/).

This docker image is based on Debian stable with some additional hacks for convenient install and use of the software.

## Features

- Easy to add corpora (just add vertical file and registry file to he appropriate location and rebuild the docker)
- CLI commands can be used directly (outside of the docker image)
- Works on any domain without changing configuration

## Usage

1. Put vert file in: `data/corpora/CORPUS_NAME/vertical` (see example in `data/corpora/susanne/vertical`)
2. Put config in: `data/registry/CORPUS_NAME` (see example in `data/registry/susanne`)
3. (Optional: password authentication) Uncomment relevant config lines in `conf/000-default.conf` and set user and password in `conf/htpasswd`   
4. `docker build . -t nosketch_engine` (can run for 5 minutes or something)
5. `docker run -p80:80 nosketch_engine`
6. Navigate to http://DOMAIN/crystal/ to use

## CLI Usage

- To run NoSketch Engine CLI commands run the docker and add the command and its parameters at the end of the original command (`docker run -it nosketch_engine COMMAND PARAMS`). E.g. `docker run -it nosketch_engine encodevert -h` 
- To get a shell in the container use the following command: `docker run -p80:80 -it --entrypoint /bin/bash nosketch_engine`

## Demo on Dockerhub

The docker image with the sample corpus included is [available on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/eltedh/nosketch-engine):

```bash
docker pull eltedh/nosketch-engine
docker run -p80:80 eltedh/nosketch-engine
```
