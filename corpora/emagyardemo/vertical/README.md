# Analyse `txt` by e-magyar and convert to NoSkE input

[`source`](source) is a NoSkE input file created from [`input.txt`](input.txt) by running [`e-magyar`](https://github.com/nytud/emtsv) analysis and some postprocessing on it.

Run `make` to recreate `source` from `input.txt`.

## Use this with _your_ corpus

1. Put your corpus here as `CORPUS.txt`
2. Run `make SOURCEFILE=CORPUS.txt`
3. Then head to the __Usage__ part of the main [`README.md`](../../../README.md)
4. And use you your brand new corpus
